### TinyML: Analysis of Xtensa LX6 Microprocessor for Neural Network Applications by ESP32 SoC  
**Md Ziaul Haque Zim**, arXiv 2021.  
🔗 https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10652  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2106.10652

**Summary:**  
This paper analyzes the computational capability of the **Xtensa LX6 dual-core 32-bit microprocessor** inside the **ESP32 SoC** for TinyML workloads.  
It evaluates the feed-forward speed of neural networks with **different input sizes and different numbers of hidden-layer neurons**, showing how model complexity affects inference latency on the ESP32.  
The work demonstrates that ESP32—traditionally viewed as a low-power IoT device—can run basic neural network inference and serves as a practical platform for **lightweight TinyML applications** using frameworks like MicroPython and TensorFlow Lite Micro.
